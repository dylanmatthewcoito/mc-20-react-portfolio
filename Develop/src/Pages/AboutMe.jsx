                My name is Dylan and I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer. My primary language is Javascript with an emphasis in
                React applications. I am from northern California and I reside in Davis, CA currently. I have worked in
                several different areas before becoming a developer including: Brewing, Beekeeping, Teaching, Service Industry,
                and working at a 5-star hotel. I enjoy camping, hiking, photography, and attending concerts. I am very excited to
                break into the tech industry and build some awesome applications. Thank you for visiting my portfolio! For more
